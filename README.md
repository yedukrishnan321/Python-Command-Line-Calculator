# 🧮 Python Command-Line Calculator
📘 Task: Build a Calculator CLI App

Objective: Create a simple command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations using Python functions and loops.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that allows users to perform basic math operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — directly from the terminal.

It demonstrates:

Function-based structure in Python

User input handling with input()

Loops for repeated execution until user exits

Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Language: Python

Editor: VS Code / Any Text Editor

Runtime: Python (3.x recommended)

Execution Environment: Terminal / Command Prompt

# 📁 Deliverables

calculator.py — main source code file

# 🧩 Features

✅ Performs Addition (+)

✅ Performs Subtraction (-)

✅ Performs Multiplication (*)

✅ Performs Division (/) (with zero-division handling)

✅ Uses functions for modular code

✅ Uses loops to allow multiple calculations

✅ Includes input validation for smooth user experience

# 🎯 Learning Outcome

By completing this task, you will:

Understand Python syntax and structure

Learn to use functions, loops, and input handling

Gain confidence in writing small CLI (Command Line Interface) applications
